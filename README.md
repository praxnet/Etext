Etext
=====

Text Editor based on the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries and Python.
This was written mostly because I was...

A) Bored
B) I wanted to learn how to use the Python EFL bindings.

I should warn you all that I am a Mechanical Engineer by trade and almost all of my
skills in programming is in MATLAB not Python so there are bound to be a few
bugs and/or better ways of doing stuff

Etext is written using the Python-Elementary and the Python-Evas libraries.
You will need both of these to use Etext. There is currently no installer and since
this is python there is no need to compile before use.
